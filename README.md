# Lilac & Peach

A pair of virtual Instruments created with [HISE](http://hise.audio, an open source framework for sample based instruments. The samples used are adapted from our Roland System 100, Oberheim Xpander and Korg Volca Keys construction kits. 

 

VST and AU Builds for Mac OS & Windows and the audio data are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/publicsamples/Lilac-Peach/releases).

Both instruments are under active development. New samples, features and updates will be forthcoming.


**Lilac** takes 3  identical voices, each with a dedicated sequencer/arpeggiator, morphable waveforms, 2 LFOs and 2 envelopes
